# Mary Ferrer's Website

This repository is for my personal portfolio website which showcases my work as a web developer and more information about my professional and personal experience.

I used Vite to initialize the repository and built the website using React and TypeScript. You can visit the website [here](www.maryferrer.dev).

To run the repository locally, first clone the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then run `npm run dev`.

Thanks for visiting!
